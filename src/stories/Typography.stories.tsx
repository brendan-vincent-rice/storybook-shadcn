        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's maintained by Facebook and a community of developers.
      </Typography>
      
      <Typography variant="h2">Getting Started</Typography>
      
      <Typography variant="p">
        React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

      </Typography>
      
      <Typography variant="blockquote">
        "React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need."
